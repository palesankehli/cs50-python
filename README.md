README editting because I can(Testing purposes)

--PROBLEM SET 0--

- First problem, kinda nervous :(
- First use of a string methods (x.lower() and x.replace()), I am on a roll!!!
- Getting familiar with converting input to int or str so I can add, subtract etc
- Used a method "pow" to solve my einstein.py
- Started with functions calling other functions in tip.py, I cannot say I am confident about it but the problem was solved
  
--PROBLEM SET 1--

- Used 2 string methods at the same time, x.lower().strip()
- Found more string methods to use x.count() and x.find()
- USing more "elif" statements at this point and more strong methods
- Learned to convert input into "float"
- Combined functions, "if" statements to solve problem

At this point I see the progress i have made as I move to other problem sets, I am proud of myself :)

--PROBLEM SET 2--

- More string methods x.isupper()
- More conditionals and how to use them for different data
- Learned how to use loop to omit letters in a string on twttr.py
- I was feeling a little too confident but plates.py humbled me, it made me remember that I still have a lot to learn
- Started using dictionaries and accessing data in them

At this point I see the progress as we are starting to use other forms of data like lists and dictionaries

--PROBLEM SET 3--

I have noticed that I am getting better at preaking down a problem into little pieces and solve them individually which helps me in understanding it better, I just need to work on the constant panic coz that is how I always start before actually sooving the problem:)
