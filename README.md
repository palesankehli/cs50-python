README editting because I can(Testing purposes)



--PROBLEM SET 0--

- First problem, kinda nervous :(
- First use of a string methods (x.lower() and x.replace()), I am on a roll!!!
- Getting familiar with converting input to int or str so I can add, subtract etc
- Used a method "pow" to solve my einstein.py
- Started with functions calling other functions in tip.py, I cannot say I am confident about it but the problem was solved
  
--PROBLEM SET 1--

- Used 2 string methods at the same time, x.lower().strip()
- Found more string methods to use x.count() and x.find()
- USing more "elif" statements at this point and more strong methods
- Learned to convert input into "float"
- Combined functions, "if" statements to solve problem

At this point I see the progress I have made as I move to other problem sets, I have also been using comments quite a lot although I clear them out when I want to clean up my code before submitting but it helps a lot, I am proud of myself :)

--PROBLEM SET 2--

- More string methods x.isupper()
- More conditionals and how to use them for different data
- Learned how to use loop to omit letters in a string on twttr.py
- I was feeling a little too confident but plates.py humbled me, it made me remember that I still have a lot to learn
- Started using dictionaries and accessing data in them

At this point I see the progress as we are starting to use other forms of data like lists and dictionaries

--PROBLEM SET 3--

- Started using the Exceptions to catch errors
I have noticed that I am getting better at breaking down a problem into little pieces and solve them individually which helps me in understanding it better, I just need to work on the constant panic coz that is how I always start before actually solving the problem:)
- Working with dictionaries has not been easy as they don't exactly have the same methods as strings that I have been working on for a while, it makes these tasks just a little harder but I am working on it. 

--PROMBLEM SET 4--

- I have started working with libraries and using terms like "import" on top of my files, being able to install a library from the command line and all. I like the idea of being able to reuse code that was written by someone else, however I feel like I am still gonna struggle a little bit with making that code work together with mine but I am up for it, Imposter's syndrome kicks in every once in a while but lookking at my progress makes me keep going :-)
